DTI_SpectralQuaternion
======================
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) operator using a "spectral quaternion" decomposition.

The repository contains Anne Collard's work on "diffusion tensor imaging". The central part is the 'difftensor' matlab object defined using a spectral-quaternion decomposition. This matlab object lets you manipulate diffusion tensors by overloading standard operations such as the distance between tensors, interpolation and averaging. See the object's help for more details. Secondly the repository contains a set of functions illustrating how the difftensor object can be employed to implement practical operations on DTI's.
